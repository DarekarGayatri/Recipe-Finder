# Recipe Finder Web Application

## Description
The **Recipe Finder** is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application leverages the Spoonacular API to fetch and display recipes, providing a user-friendly interface for cooking enthusiasts.

### Key Features:
- **Ingredient Input**: Users can enter a list of ingredients (comma-separated) to find matching recipes.
- **Recipe Display**: The application fetches and displays recipes, including images, ingredient lists, and cooking instructions.
- **Favorites Functionality**: Users can save their favorite recipes to local storage for easy access later. The favorites can be viewed and managed within the application.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

### Code Structure:
- **HTML**: The structure includes an input field for ingredients, a search button, and a section to display recipe results.
- **CSS**: The styling provides a modern and clean look, with responsive grid layouts for recipe cards and hover effects for buttons.
- **JavaScript**: The script handles API requests to fetch recipes based on user input, updates the UI with recipe details, and manages the favorites functionality.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter ingredients in the input field and click "Search Recipes" to find matching recipes.
4. Save your favorite recipes by clicking the "Save to Favorites" button on each recipe card.

This project serves as a practical example of integrating APIs with front-end technologies, enhancing user experience through dynamic content and local storage management. It is an excellent tool for anyone looking to explore new recipes based on available ingredients.
